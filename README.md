# Deep-Learning-Based-Image-Classification-with-Transfer-Learning-and-Fine-Tuning
This project uses the Airplanes, Motorbikes, and Schooners dataset to classify images using pretrained models (Xception, ResNet101V2, InceptionResNetV2). Both transfer learning and fine-tuning are applied, achieving high precision, recall, and F1-scores.
